        [INT. LORDZECK'S OFFICE - DAY]

        [Lordzeck, a tech developer, sits at his desk, intensely coding a website. A digital clock on the wall reads "7 Hours Until Launch". 😱]

        [Enter GLORIA, Lordzeck's curvy wife, wearing yoga pants, begins her yoga routine in front of Lordzeck. 🧘‍♀️]

        GLORIA
        (flashing a smile)
        Hey, honey! I'm going to do some yoga. Care to join? 😘

        [Lordzeck smiles but continues typing on his computer. 💻]

        LORDZECK
        (eyes fixed on the screen)
        I've got this website to finish, love. Maybe later? 🙏

        [Gloria begins her yoga routine, striking various poses, unintentionally distracting Lordzeck. 😍]

        [Lordzeck tries to focus, but Gloria's presence is too distracting. He scoops her up like a baby and carries her outside to the garden. 🏃‍♂️]

        EXT. LORDZECK'S GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

        [Lordzeck places Gloria on a yoga mat in the serene garden, then heads back inside. 🌳]

        [Minutes pass. Gloria sneakily returns, wearing even more enticing attire, trying to grab Lordzeck's attention again. 😏]

        GLORIA
        (coyly)
        You sure you don't want to join me? It's really fun! 🎉

        [Lordzeck tries to resist but eventually gives in. He carries her outside once more. 🙈]

        EXT. LORDZECK'S GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

        [Lordzeck sets Gloria on the mat again, tries to return inside, but Gloria surprises him by coming back yet again, now in a sultry manner. 😈]

        GLORIA
        (seductively)
        Why code when you can indulge in something more exciting, darling? 😜

        [Lordzeck, caught off guard, sighs, realizing he won't get any work done. 😔]

        LORDZECK
        (surrendering)
        Alright, you win! 🏳️

        [He joins Gloria on the mat, starting to do yoga with her. They share a romantic moment, forgetting about the impending website launch. 💕]

        FADE OUT. 🎬
