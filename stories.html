        <h2>chapter: 1</h2>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, in the deep village of <strong>Kigamba</strong>, nestled within rolling hills and lush vegetation, a beautiful love story began to take shape. <strong>Lordzeck</strong> and <strong>Gloria</strong>, two souls who had shared their childhood in this peaceful village, embarked on a journey that would length a decade of separation, only to find their paths crossing once again.
             </p>

             <p>Their story began in the halls of <strong>Kigamba</strong> Primary School, where they would catch sights of each other daily, sharing friendly smiles and occasional greetings. As they grew older, they continued their education together at Kiyuni Secondary School, though they were not in the same class.

             </p>

             <p> In their younger years, <strong>Lordzeck</strong> and <strong>Gloria</strong> attended the same <strong>Kigamba</strong> Primary School, walking the dusty paths to their classrooms and exchanging looks that sparked an interest within them.

             </p>

             <p>
                Their paths converged further as they both continued their education at Kiyuni Secondary School. It was at Kiyuni that they had their last meeting in 2013, when they took a photo together, capturing a brief moment frozen in time. Little did they know that life would soon take them on different routes, causing them to lose touch with each other.

             </p>

                <p> 
                    As the years passed, their memories of that crucial photo together began to fade, and life's responsibilities led them in separate directions. <strong>Lordzeck</strong> remained at Kiyuni Secondary School, pushing forward with his studies, while <strong>Gloria</strong>'s journey took her abroad, far from her childhood friend. Even though they were in the same schools, they had never been in the same class, and as the years went by, the chances of seeing each other again grew slimmer.

                </p>
<p>It wasn't until early December 1st, 2022, that fate decided to intervene. <strong>Lordzeck</strong>  mostly know as <strong>Zeki</strong> by most local friends found himself scrolling through Facebook, recalling about his past, when he stumbled upon a familiar name - <strong>Gloria</strong>, affectionately known as <strong>Liika</strong>. Memories of their school days rushed back, and he couldn't resist sending her a friend request, hoping she might remember him too.</p>
           
<p>To his delight, <strong>Gloria</strong> recognized his name and accepted the request without hesitation. Their joyous reunion became a gateway to repair a connection that had sat dormant for a decade. As they exchanged messages, laughter, and heartfelt conversations, it was as if the years of separation had never existed.

</p>

<p>Though they hadn't been best friends, their newfound connection was like reviving an old flame that had been quietly lost purpose all along. They discovered shared interests, exchanged stories of their journeys over the past years, and found comfort in the warmth of their virtual friendship.
</p>


<p>As they chatted, their friendship grew into something deeper. The more they talked, the more they realized that their hearts were drawn to one another. They couldn't help but share their hopes and dreams, feeling an undeniable bond that seemed to grow stronger with each passing day.
</p>

<p>Through voice notes, video calls, and long messages, they nurtured their connection, promising each other that they would be the happiest couple on earth and the best lovers they could be for one another. Their virtual engagement became a source of inspiration for those around them, as they witnessed the magic that bound them together, even across the distance.</p>

<p>The expectation of finally meeting in person was profound, but they knew they had to wait a little longer. <strong>Gloria</strong> was still abroad, where she had gone to work, and <strong>Lordzeck</strong> eagerly awaited her return to <strong>Uganda</strong>, his home country.</p>

<p>As the days turned into weeks, their feelings deepened, and their love story continued to unfold across the digital empire. They cherished every moment of their virtual courtship, knowing that their love was worth waiting for.</p>

<p>In the next couple of months, they shared their family backgrounds, discussing their parents, the number of children in their families, and the positions of their births. To their surprise, they realized they were both born on the same day of the week - Tuesday. This coincidence became a charming discovery, and they started noticing other instances of the number 7 appearing in their lives. <strong>Gloria</strong> was born in the 7th month of the year, and <strong>Lordzeck</strong> was the 7th born in his family. The number 7 seemed to symbolize the mysterious connections that united them.</p>



<p>Furthermore, they found another shared trait in the number 3. <strong>Lordzeck</strong> was born on the 30th of May, while <strong>Gloria</strong>'s birthday was on the 3rd of July. This providence added to the wall-hanging of their connection, deepening their charming with the similarities they found between them.</p>


<p>As they continued to share their life stories, another commonality emerged. Both <strong>Lordzeck</strong> and <strong>Gloria</strong> had lost their fathers early, leaving them with only their mothers. Despite the sadness that this loss brought, they found relief in the understanding that they shared this aspect of their lives.</p>



<p>Their connections were so profound that they playfully referred to themselves as "<strong>Twin</strong>s" from that moment onwards. Calling each other "<strong>Twin</strong>" became a romantic nickname that symbolized their deep bond and the multitude of similarities they discovered.</p>



<p>They were not biological <strong>Twin</strong>s, but their hearts felt as if they were soulmates destined to share their lives with one another.

It's like fate brought us together.</p>
