        <p>
            Once upon a time, in the deep village of  <strong>kigamba</strong> , nestled within rolling hills and luxurious vegetation and foothills, a beautiful love story began to take nature.  <strong>Lordzeck</strong> and  <strong>Gloria</strong>, two souls who shared their childhood in this village where there is no village a head, get on on a journey that would time a decade of separation found their paths crossing once again.
             </p>
             <p>Their story began in the halls of  <strong>kigamba</strong>  Primary School, where they could see each other daily, sharing friendly smiles and occasional greetings. As they grew older, they continued their education together at  <strong>kiyuni secondary school</strong> , though they were not in the same class.

             </p>
             <p>In their younger years,  <strong>Lordzeck</strong> and Gloria attended the same  <strong>kigamba</strong>  Primary School, where they would catch signs of each other daily while walking the dusty paths to their classrooms. Though they weren't in the same class, their eyes would meet, and a spark of interest would explode within them.

             </p>

             <p>Their paths come together further as they both continued their education at  <strong>kiyuni secondary school</strong> . It was at Kiyuni that they had their last meeting in 2013, when they took a photo together, capturing a brief moment freezing in time. Little did they know that life would soon take them on different routes, and they would lose touch with each other.

                <p>As the years passed, their memories of that memorable photo together began to fade, and life's responsibilities led them in separate directions.  <strong>Lordzeck</strong> remained in  <strong>kiyuni secondary school</strong>  pushing studies, while Gloria's journey took her to different direction, away from her childhood friend. Even though being in the same schools, they had never been in the same class, and as the years went by, the chances of seeing each other again grew slimmer and way to meet again tightened more.

</p>
<p>It wasn't until early 1st December 2023 that luck decided to occur.  <strong>Lordzeck</strong> found himself scrolling through Facebook, recalling about his past, when he fell upon a familiar name â€“ Gloria mostly known to be Liika. Memories of their school days rushed back, and he couldn't resist sending her a friend request, hoping she might remember him too.</p>
